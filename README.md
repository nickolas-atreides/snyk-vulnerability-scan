Code vulnerability scan (IBM Cybersecurity Analyst program)

Snyk is a developer-first cybersecurity platform that helps identify and fix vulnerabilities in open-source libraries and container images. It allows developers to proactively detect and address security issues in their code, preventing potential cyber threats and ensuring safer software development.

The goal of secure SDLC (Secure Software Development Lifecycle) is to identify and address security vulnerabilities at each stage, from planning and design to development, testing, and deployment, reducing the risk of security breaches and ensuring the creation of secure software.

Snyk can help with Secure SDLC by providing developers with the tools and insights needed to address security concerns at various stages of the development process. Let's take as an example an open-source game engine Godot. By using Snyk we identify quite a few vulnerabilities, which are important to take note of before releasing a game based on this code.

Let's take a look at the expanded vulnerability information

Right here we can see how Snyk recommends fixing the issue
